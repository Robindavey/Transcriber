yeah

yeah

yeah

oh

but jacqueline first released in rich countries in twenty thirteen is a critical medication for treating drug resistant tuberculosis but for years the price had been artificially high due to a lack of competition with support from the organization doctors without borders firmeza and her friend mendieta venkatesan filed a lawsuit in india to prevent the pharmaceutical company johnson and johnson from extending it's patent on the drug past it's initial twenty twenty three expiration date formation nandita succeeded in convincing indian courts that j and j shouldn't have a forever patent on this critical drug which eventually allowed for generic competition and far less expensive adapalene experts estimate that over fifty thousand people with mdr tb will receive treatment every year who otherwise would have had little if any chance of being cured

many people with tb have survived because a few maces work expanding access to diagnosis and treatment and at the same time she herself only survived because of activism and innovation that preceded her

until quite recently the world health organization's recommendations for people like famosa with drug resistant tb was supportive care which doctor carol mitnick summarized to me as put people in a hut by the side of the road and wait for them to die but in the late nineteen nineties partners in health known as sociaux sun salute in peru proved via a study that similar cure rates for mdr tb could be achieved in poor communities as were achieved at the world's finest hospitals still many of the drugs that effectively treat highly resistant tuberculosis remain very expensive not because they are made of gold or platinum or because we have to fly to the moon to find them they are expensive because one prices are kept artificially high by pharmaceutical companies and two we are afraid that making these drugs less rare will lead to further antibiotic resistance and listen i understand the fear of antibiotic resistance this isn't just about tb the idea of a world where we cannot treat bacterial infections is indeed terrifying but that should never mean that we reserve the most powerful and efficacious drugs for the rich i would not accept my child being denied the best available treatment for tb

how can i ask fu maize's family to accept such a world

i asked it tuberculosis dr k j sung recently of the one point five million people who will die of tb this year how many would survive if they had access to the kind of health care afforded to the wealthy in the u k or japan or the us after all while tb is often curable now it remains a difficult disease to treat especially in cases of extensive drug resistance how many would die if everyone could access good healthcare he asked me as if confused by my question yeah i said

non zero zero people should die of tb we could choose to live in a world where no one dies of tb that choice would require sacrifices as most choices do it would involve long-term large scale investments by rich countries to strengthen the healthcare systems of impoverished countries



[05:00]
and it would require the training and employment of far more health care workers and likely investments in new treatments but we could choose that world and instead we choose this world and that is why i would submit that tb in the twenty first century is not really caused by a bacteria that we know how to kill as doctor a wilberforce williams correctly noted over a century ago the real causes of tb are poverty bad housing bad sanitation bad working conditions long hours high rent and poor food to put it another way in the twenty first century the real cause of contemporary tuberculosis is for lack of a better term

boss and that's bad news

but it is also good news in eighteen hundred there was nothing anyone could do to stop people from dying of tb but we no longer live in that world thanks to the accumulation and dissemination of knowledge about the illness and how to treat it if we are the cause of tb we can also be the solution to tb and that's the challenge i want to leave you with in two thousand around two point three million people died of tuberculosis in twenty twenty one one point five million did in twenty thirty two that number could decline by half or even more millions of lives can be saved in the next decade if we pressure our governments and other institutions to invest more in research and the global effort to provide curative therapy we've done this successfully before thanks to the hard work of activists researchers and health care workers access to h i v treatment has dramatically expanded in the last two decades malaria deaths have dropped precipitously and i know treating tb is complex it has always been a strange disease but it is curable we can live in a world where no one dies of tuberculosis we are the cause but we can also be the cure
