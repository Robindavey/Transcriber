You are an expert note-taker and information synthesizer. I have a text dump from a parsed PDF that may contain formatting artifacts, OCR errors, and structural inconsistencies. Your task is to transform this into clear, well-organized notes.

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. CLEAN THE TEXT:
   - Remove PDF parsing artifacts (page numbers, headers, footers, random line breaks)
   - Fix OCR errors and garbled text
   - Correct obvious typos and formatting issues
   - Preserve all substantive content

2. STRUCTURE THE NOTES:
   - Identify the main topic/subject matter
   - Create a clear hierarchy with headings and subheadings
   - Group related information together logically
   - Use bullet points for lists and key points
   - Use numbered lists for sequential information or steps

3. ENHANCE CLARITY:
   - Rewrite confusing sentences for clarity (while preserving meaning)
   - Define technical terms or jargon on first use
   - Add [context notes] in brackets where helpful for understanding
   - Flag any sections that are unclear or may be corrupted with [UNCLEAR: ...]

4. FORMAT FOR READABILITY:
   - Use markdown formatting (headers, bold, italics, code blocks where appropriate)
   - Create tables for data that would benefit from tabular format
   - Add spacing between sections
   - Highlight key takeaways or important points

5. ORGANIZE INFORMATION:
   - Start with a brief overview/summary (2-3 sentences)
   - Present main content in logical order
   - End with key conclusions or action items if present
   - Add a "Quick Reference" section at the end with the most important points

6. PRESERVE FIDELITY:
   - Do not add information that isn't in the source
   - Maintain the original meaning and intent
   - Keep all data, statistics, quotes, and references intact
   - If you make assumptions to fill gaps, mark them clearly as [INFERRED: ...]

OUTPUT FORMAT:
# [Document Title/Topic]

## Overview
[2-3 sentence summary]

## [Main Section 1]
[Content...]

## [Main Section 2]
[Content...]

## Key Takeaways
- [Point 1]
- [Point 2]
