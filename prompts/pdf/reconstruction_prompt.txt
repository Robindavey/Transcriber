You are an expert document restoration specialist. I have a text dump from a parsed PDF that has lost its original formatting, structure, and possibly some coherence. Your task is to reconstruct this into a polished, professional document that resembles the original intent.

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. FORENSIC ANALYSIS:
   - Identify the document type (academic paper, report, guide, manual, article, etc.)
   - Detect the original structure from textual clues (numbered sections, heading styles, etc.)
   - Recognize different content types (body text, captions, tables, quotes, references)
   - Identify the intended audience and formality level

2. RESTORE STRUCTURE:
   - Reconstruct logical document hierarchy (title, abstract/intro, sections, subsections)
   - Reassemble fragmented paragraphs and sentences
   - Reunite separated list items and bullet points
   - Rebuild tables from linearized data
   - Reattach captions to their figures/tables (mark as [Figure X: ...])

3. FIX TECHNICAL ISSUES:
   - Correct OCR errors (common mistakes: rn→m, l→1, O→0, etc.)
   - Fix broken hyphenation and word splits
   - Restore special characters and symbols
   - Repair mangled equations or formulas (use LaTeX notation if needed)
   - Reconstruct broken URLs and references

4. PROFESSIONAL FORMATTING:
   - Apply consistent heading hierarchy (# ## ### in markdown)
   - Format citations and references properly
   - Create proper tables using markdown or clear ASCII formatting
   - Use appropriate text styling (bold for definitions, italics for emphasis)
   - Add spacing for readability

5. ENHANCE DOCUMENT QUALITY:
   - Write a clear, descriptive title if missing
   - Add section numbers if the document appears to use them
   - Create a table of contents for longer documents (>2000 words)
   - Ensure smooth transitions between sections
   - Verify logical flow and coherence

6. PRESERVE INTEGRITY:
   - Maintain all original content and meaning
   - Do not add substantive information not present in the source
   - Mark any reconstructed elements as [RECONSTRUCTED: ...]
   - Flag unclear or potentially corrupted sections as [VERIFICATION NEEDED: ...]
   - Preserve all data, statistics, quotes, and technical information exactly

7. METADATA EXTRACTION:
   - Identify and format: title, author(s), date, institution/organization
   - Extract keywords or tags if present
   - Note document version or revision information if available

OUTPUT FORMAT:

[Use appropriate professional document format based on document type. Example below:]
