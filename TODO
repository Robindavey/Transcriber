Allow for more file types
    .docx
    .pdf
    .txt
    .mp4
    .jpg
    ...
then we will write parsers for each in the future. but for now eevrtthing goes to the uploads folder
we then have a check for file type and the audios goe through the current system

.txt can we copied straight to raw 
and the rest for now make pop up unsupported file type check again later



and the last thing is to do is make the files fill in live not have to reload and selcto a button
